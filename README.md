NOTES:

HTML:
1) HTML is everywhere, it is used on websites, apps and various software whenever web tech is involved. It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences
2) HTML Is short for HyperText Markup Language it is responsible for structuring/marking up a website. HTML has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions and because of this it is known as a declarative language.
3) The great thing about HTML lies in its simplicity, which gives it resilience and robustness, even if something is wrong with the HTML code, such as missing or misspelled elements, HTML will take a guess and fix it and will display this page anyway. HTML is a language that can handle a lot of abuse and still manage to deliver a functional result.

CSS: 
5) CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, CSS is basically like the stylist of a web page. It is responsible for how everything looks this means the colors, fonts, and sizes but is not limited here, since it can also add cool animations and interactions to spice things up.
6) CSS unlike HTML is very sensitive and very powerful at the same time. When there is a mistake in the CSS code, the browser is smart enough to skip that part and move on to the rest.

JAVASCRIPT:
7) JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create really cool and interactive stuff, it is capable of doing this HTML and CSS can't even think of doing. The downside of this is that it is very fragile as a programming language if there is a mistake in the code or the browser is outdated then the browser will also give up and not even attempt to fix or display the code
