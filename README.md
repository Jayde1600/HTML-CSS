NOTES:

HTML:
1) HTML is everywhere, it is used on websites, apps and various software whenever web tech is involved. It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences
2) HTML Is short for HyperText Markup Language it is responsible for structuring/marking up a website. HTML has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions and because of this it is known as a declarative language.
3) The great thing about HTML lies in its simplicity, which gives it resilience and robustness, even if something is wrong with the HTML code, such as missing or misspelled elements, HTML will take a guess and fix it and will display this page anyway. HTML is a language that can handle a lot of abuse and still manage to deliver a functional result.

CSS: 
5) CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, CSS is basically like the stylist of a web page. It is responsible for how everything looks this means the colors, fonts, and sizes but is not limited here, since it can also add cool animations and interactions to spice things up.
6) CSS unlike HTML is very sensitive and very powerful at the same time. When there is a mistake in the CSS code, the browser is smart enough to skip that part and move on to the rest.

JAVASCRIPT:
7) JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create really cool and interactive stuff, it is capable of doing this HTML and CSS can't even think of doing. The downside of this is that it is very fragile as a programming language if there is a mistake in the code or the browser is outdated then the browser will also give up and not even attempt to fix or display the code 

8) The Web runs on various platforms like Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, and more. It even runs on devices like e-book readers, game consoles, televisions, and watches.

HTML Syntax:
9) HTML is a language used to structure web pages. It uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements. Tags come in two types: opening tags and closing tags. For example, the opening tag for a paragraph is <p>, and the closing tag is </p>

10) Browsers pay attention to this structure and builds a big family tree which shows how everything is related. This family tree is called a DOM tree, which stands for Document Object Model. The DOM tree becomes important when you are working with CSS or JavaScript.

11) Example of some HTML Code:
<article>
  <h1> This is the article heading </h1>
    <p> Hello, this is a test drive </p>
    <p> More test words, in here </p>
</article>

13) The HTML elements used for marking up headlines/headings come in six different types: h1 being the largest one, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 being the smallest. The headings get smaller as you go up in numbers but only up to 6.

14) HTML Bold and Italics, there are four HTML elements related to this, two for bold and two for italic. For bold it is <strong> and <b> and for italics it is <i> and <em>

15) A Unordered lists is the most commonly used type of list. Each item in the list is enclosed in an <li> element, which represents a list item. When you view it in the browser, notice that a dot or marker appears before each item. To define the entire list and specify its type, it will be wrapped in a <ul> element, which stands for an unordered list.
16) There is another type of list called the "definition list" or "description list. To create a definition list, we use specific elements. The term or key is enclosed in a <dt> which is called a definition term and the <dd> tag is which stands for definition description
17) To attritube a quote to Jemery we use the <cite> tag in order to make it look like this - Jemery and the whole text will get wrapped in <blockquote> text here <cite> Mr Jemery </cite> </blockquote>. In order to get our text to be wrapped with quotion marks we use <q> Hello, I'm Aphiwe </q> results = "Hello, I'm Aphiwe"
  
18) HTML attributes provide additional information to HTML elements. In this case, the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand. We write it like this: <time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>.
19) To show a specific moment or time for the computer to understand we use this for example, we can use it like this: <time>May 8th</time> or <time>May 8th 2025</time>

HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text:
20) This is usually used for when you need to display a math sign like for e.g. 5 to the power of 8
